# **THREAT FEED / EXTERNAL DYNAMIC LIST**

This list includes the IP addresses of bots which are trying to log in to your SSLVPN or your perimeter device interface. The IP addresses are collected from private source and are updated weekly.

## **Implementation:**

### FORTIGATE
Security Fabric -> External connectors -> Create New -> Threat Feeds > IP Address -> URI of external resource: **https://raw.githubusercontent.com/threat-feed/threat-feeds-repo/main/IP_Threat_Feed.txt**

If you have MGMT and SSLVPN on a loopback interface use this list as a source in security policy which denies access to VIP.
If you donâ€™t have SSLVPN on a loopback interface, you can also use it in SSLVPN settings to deny them to connect to VPN but they will still be able to reach your public facing interface.
